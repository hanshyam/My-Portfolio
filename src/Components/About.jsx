          Hello! I'm Ghanshyam Patidar, a passionate Frontend Developer with a
          strong interest in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I specialize
          in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have hands-on experience with
          frameworks like React and Angular through various personal and
          academic projects. Although I haven't worked in a company or startup
          yet, my projects showcase my ability to create user-friendly,
          responsive web interfaces. My strong understanding of DSA helps me
          solve complex problems efficiently. I continuously engage in coding
          challenges and tech blogging to stay updated in the fast-evolving tech
          landscape. I'm detail-oriented, collaborative, and always eager to
          learn and innovate, striving to deliver high-quality
          digitalÂ solutions.
